# IART-Project-2

Project developed for the Artifitial Intelligence class.

This project was developed with the aim of estimating the growth of the covid-19 numbers, with the aid of several Machine Learning Algorithms.

## Results:

Here you can see the comparison between the predicted values, and the actual values of the coronavirus spread, among several countries, adjusted to population. Several methods were used.

### K-Nearest-Neighbours, prediction for UK:
